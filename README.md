# PodCom Podcast Sharing App  

A place for podcast lovers to share their favorite podcasts and find new ones to follow.

## Description

This project was used as a means to familiarize myself with the Django framework. This project builds on my previous Django project by utilizing Class-Based Views rather than Function-Based Views. It also includes user registration/authorization, login/logout functionality, permissions, more advanced querying, and a richer set of features available to the user. In addition, I have now added
dynamic retrieval of relevant podcast information via the iTunes API.

Please note this is a work in progress: more advanced features will be added with time. Priorities have shifted to other projects but
I am adding occasional updates as I learn about new things that can be easily added.
